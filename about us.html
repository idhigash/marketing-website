                Our story starts with one man, a dream and a bedroom converted to an office.

                    In 2019, Ishank noticed the growing momentum of digital marketing in the business world and took
                    hold by founding Marketing Essentials from a bedroom in his home.

                    With years of operations management, marketing, sales and strategic planning backing his new
                    venture, he had a goal to build a digital agency that helped business leaders support and advance
                    their growth goals.

                    His endless energy, drive and passion grew the business to an in-house team of more than 25 digital
                    marketing and sales experts today.

                    Marketing Essentials is now located in a modern, high-tech office space in Minster, Ohio.

                    The companies we work with seek a trusted partner they can count on for expert digital marketing and
                    sales strategy, tactics, advice and coaching. At Marketing Essentials, businesses grow because
                    people are thriving.
